# openEQUELLA-Tools

These tools have been through the initial stage of being open sourced, and are available for use.  They are as-is, and should be validated before being used against an Equella install with live data on it.  Validation efforts include:
* Dependency review
* Enhance the build process to be consistent
* Tests - since these were developed as adhoc helper scripts, not alot of effort has been put into code coverage.  Certain projects have some coverage, but some of the supporting data had to be removed as part of the open sourcing effort.
