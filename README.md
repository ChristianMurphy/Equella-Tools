# Equella-Tools

These tools have been through the initial stage of being open sourced, and are available for use.  They are as-is, and should be validated before being used against an Equella install with live data on it.  Validation efforts include:
* Dependency review
* Enhance the build process to be consist
* autotests - since these were developed as adhoc helper scripts, not alot of effort has been put into code coverage.  Certain projects have some coverage.

## Documentation
Please keep all documentation in the master [docs repo](https://github.com/equella/equella.github.io/blob/master/equella-tools/).
