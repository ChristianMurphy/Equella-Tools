# Can be 'attachments', 'items', or 'direct'
# 'items' will call the Equella web UI and ping the items
# 'attachments' performs the 'items' actions, and will also check each associated attachment
# 'direct' will walk through the filestore, and for each item uuid/version, query the DB to compare attachments.  No web UI calls.
