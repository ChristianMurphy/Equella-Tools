# Benchmark performance test assets
The performance tests need a small set of assets / files.  Due to the open sourcing effort, some of these needed to be removed.  Here is the manifest to rebuild the assets.  Note - some of the scripts will need to be adjusted to handle the rebuilt assets being a different size.  The JMeter test will fail on the size assertion if it is affected by the asset rebuild.
